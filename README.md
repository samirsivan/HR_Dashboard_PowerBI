# HR_PowerBI

Accurate analysis of employee data and performance by the Human Resources department positively impacts company success. To remain competitive and minimize costs, employers adopt Business Intelligence, allowing direct observation of employee performance and processes through dashboards.

# In this analysis, I aim to answer the following questions:
  How many employees are eligible for promotion, having not been promoted in the last 10 years, and what is their proportion?
  
  What are the years of service for the employees?
  
  What is the distribution of employees across occupation levels from 1 to 5?
  
  We plan to dismiss employees who have been with the company for 18 years, while the rest will stay. How many employees will be laid off, and how many will remain?
  
  How far do employees live from the office?
  
  What is the departmental distribution of employees who will be promoted or fired, and which department will see the most changes?
  
  What are the levels of job satisfaction among employees?
  
  What percentage of employees are working overtime?
  
  When evaluating employee performance as high or low, what are the respective ratios?
  
  What are the total numbers and distributions of employees, promotions, and dismissals across different occupational roles?
  
  Who are the employees that will be promoted or fired?

  job satisfaction.

# Recommendations
  Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
  
  Promotion Policy Review:  Instead of waiting for 10 years or more before considering promotions, consider offering promotion opportunities at shorter intervals. This can     enhance employee motivation and engagement.
  
  Performance-Based Layoffs:  Rather than implementing a blanket layoff of 117 employees with 18 years or more of service, consider a performance-based approach. Evaluate      employees based on their current performance and contribution to the organization before making layoff decisions.
  
  Skill Enhancement for Level 1 and 2 Employees:  Provide in-service training and development programs aimed at enhancing the skills and capabilities of employees at job       levels 1 and 2. This can empower them to progress to higher levels within the organization.
  
  Addressing Job Satisfaction Issues:  Conduct interviews and surveys with employees who have low job satisfaction levels to identify underlying reasons for their              dissatisfaction. Based on the findings, implement improvement initiatives to address their concerns and enhance overall job satisfaction.
  
  These recommendations aim to optimize employee development, motivation, and satisfaction while aligning organizational decisions with performance-based criteria for a more   effective workforce management strategy.
